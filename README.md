MOBASE AI Models Hub is an AI model platform that integrates various Vision, Sound, and Sensor-based recognition technologies.

We are developing AI application for **Safety control, Sensor recognition, Human interactive devices, Display devices, Wearable devices, and more in the Mobility fields.** Most of our AI models are optimized for edge devices and operate without cloud connectivity, ensuring real-time processing and security.

Please refer to the [documentation below](##🛠️AI-Models) for more details. If you have any questions, you can get answers through the [contact information below](##📎Contact).

## 🛠️ Our Workflow

We train AI models with optimized architectures for target devices using our custom-built datasets. Subsequently, we perform quantization according to the target device and customer requirements, then test and deploy the integrated functionality and specifications.
